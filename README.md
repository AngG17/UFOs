# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Create a webpage to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

### Results
This webpage is easy to use.  Simply type in your search criteria in one of the filter boxes and hit enter.  Doing this will make it easier for analysis by date, city, state, country or shape.  You can also filter on more than one criteria, but know that it needs to be an exact match for all criteria entered in order for results to display.  When you want to perform another search, you can either click on 'UFO Sightings' at the top of the page or delete any previous filters before starting again.  Please see screenshots below for what your screen should look like after applying a filter.

### Summary

#### Drawback
- The user must know specific dates, cities or shapes to search and exactly how words are spelled with no capitalized words

#### Recommendations
- Have the master list update on a daily basis
- Have a drop down of choices for some of the filters instead of typing in what you want to search for
- Allow for partial word searches and capitalized words
